Implement a MinHeap class that supports:
    - Building a Min Heap from an input array of integers.
    - Inserting integers in the heap.
    - Removing the heap's minimum/root value.
    - Peeking at the heap's minimum/root value.
    - Sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used when inserting and removing values.
