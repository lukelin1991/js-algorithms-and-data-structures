/*
Two Num Sum
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum.
If any 2 numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order.
If no 2 numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

note that target sum has to be obtained by summing 2 different integers in the array; can't add single integer
to itself in order to obtain the target sum.
Assume that there will be at most 1 pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.

Sample Input
array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
targetSum = 10

Sample Output
[-1, 11] numbers could be in reverse order
