/*
A sawtooth sequence is a sequence of numbers that alternate between increasing and decreasing. In
other words, each element is either strictly greater than its neighbouring elements or strictly less
than its neighbouring elements.

Given an array of integers arr, your task is to count the number of contiguous subarrays that
represent a sawtooth sequence of at least two elements.
